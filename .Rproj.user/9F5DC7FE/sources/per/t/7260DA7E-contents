#' @title crep_easyicc
#'
#' @description Calculates the intraclass correlation coefficient on all main effects
#' and interactions. The supplied dataframe should be long, with ratings in one column,
#' rater in a second, and item identifier (usually a number, 1-11 for the RIBA or 1-26
#' for the SOM) in a third. Each row should be a single item: one rating from one rater
#' on one subject. If you have an expert rater to compare other raters to,
#' you will need to supply their associated factor name to the "expert" argument.
#'
#' Every other column in the dataframe will be included as a possible confounder, which
#' makes this procedure valid for repeated measures analysis if a column for subject is
#' included. All columns will be treated as factors unless specified otherwise.
#'
#' @usage crep_easyicc(df, rating = "rating", rater = "rater", item = "item", expert = "", num = c())
#'
#' @param df The dataframe that contains your IRR data.
#' @param rating A string with the column name of your dependent variable - the ratings for each rater.
#' Defaults to "rating".
#' @param rater A string with the column name of your 'rater' variable. Defaults to "rater".
#' @param item A string with the column name of the item. Defaults to "item".
#' @param expert (Optional.) A string the the name of your expert rater, should you have one.
#' @param num (Optional.) A list of strings with the column names of variables that should be treated as numeric.

#' @details
#' Rather than ANOVA, `crep_easyicc()` estimates the ICC using a linear mixed effects
#' approach as described in Chen et al. (2017), estimated through REML. Specifically, it uses
#' `lme4::lmer()` to estimate an LME model using all main and interaction effects (except the
#' highest-level interaction). Because of this, values may differ marginally from the ANOVA-based
#' approaches implemented in the `irrICC` package. Compared to ANOVA, the LME approach can handle
#' missing data and confounding effects, and will never return negative values. It can also be
#' used to examine the degree of agreement for variables other than rater (see example below).
#'
#' @return The ICC, with F and p values.
